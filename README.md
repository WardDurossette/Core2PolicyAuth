# Core 2 - Policy Auth Example

This is an attempt to free form setup Policy Auth by hand after reading the MSDN article from Dino Esposito "Policy-Based Authorization in ASP.NET Core"

It's an older article from the Octoer 2017 MSDN Magazine, and dotNet Core 2.x has been released since then. 
So I am going to try and hand implent what he is talking about and learn the differnces (if any) from then to now in dotNet Core.
